## Definition

#### NFT - Non-fungible Token

Wikipedia: A non-fungible token (NFT) is a special type of cryptographic token which represents something unique; non-fungible tokens are thus not mutually interchangeable. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and many network or utility tokens that are fungible in nature.

---

In short, fungible item can be easily replaced with another identical item that and its value wil remain the same; non-fungible - each item is unique, has its own value and cannot be replaced with another item.
